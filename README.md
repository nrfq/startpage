# Nick's startpage
Code for my personalized browser startpage, hosted on GitHub pages

This code assumes you have your own copy of the bootstrap 5 source files in /src/styles/bootstrap.
You can run command "gulp" to compile the bootstrap and custom scss to css, and watch for changes in those files.

All of the images used are inline SVGs that I edited, mostly taken from https://github.com/gilbarbara/logos.
